# Neovim

Neovim is a variation of vim with nicer configurations. This is my standard IDE or PIDE (personalised integrated developer enviroment) for most of my projects.

Original credit goes to [This kickstart nvim layout](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) because it is fantastic and should be a great baseline for everyone.

## Notes:

* There is a custom search in telescope here with a <leader>st for ts and tsx files because i work a lot woth those file types and want to live grep only those.
* You should also check out harpoon if you do a lot of file swapping [link to harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon).
